## Overview

This is a simple Pygame-based alien shooter game that I did for Python practice.  It's from the excellent [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e/) book.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3
- Pygame


To install Pygame, run:
```
$ python -m pip install --user pygame
```

If you need to specify Python3, then run:
```
$ python3 -m pip install --user pygame
```

> If this command doesnâ€™t work on macOS, try running the command again without the `--user` flag.

## Running the Game

To run this game, navigate to the directory with the `alien_invasion.py` file and run:

```
python alien_invasion.py
```

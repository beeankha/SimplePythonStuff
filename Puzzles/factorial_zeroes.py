# Write an algorithm which computes the number of trailing zeroes in `n` factorial.

# Step 1: Figure out if the number is a number and also not "0"
# Step 2: Get the result of `n` factorial
# Step 3: Put that result in a list, separated by a ","
# Step 4: Check the last digit in the list, and if it's a 0, add to a tally and also
#         check the next number to see if it's a zero, etc.
# Step 5: Get the tally of zeroes, print it out as the result

# Normally can import `math` modules, but we'll use a custom function here.

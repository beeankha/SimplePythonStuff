# There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array of candies,
# where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has,
# and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that
# you have.

# Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if,
# after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest
# number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

# Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.
